### Summary

We are going to implement a parallel version of a fluid simulator to run on Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU's on the Gates machines and compare that to a sequential implementation on a CPU.

### Background

We are implementing a parallel computational fluid dynamics simulator to run on GPU's. For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming the fluids to be homogeneous and incompressible. We plan to take advantage of the fact that GPU's are optimized to render textures, and a texture is just a 2D vector storing multiple values. We can thus store our simulation grids as these textures. Instead of having each pixel in the texture map correspond to a particle, we are going to have a grid of particles and store each grid componenet as a pixel texture. The inherent structure of CFD simulations thus makes it best suited to be run through CUDA kernels on the GPU. 

We will be representing the fluid as a simulation grid, which is indexed in by their position, and stores a time and velocity (since velocity and location change based on time). In our simulation we need to account for four things: advection, pressure, diffusion, and external forces. Advection refers to the movement of particles from one region to another. Pressure accounts to the fact that particles closer to a force will move with greater velocity than those further away. Diffusion accounts for viscocity of fluids. External forces refer to the actual forces that act on the fluid. The Navier-Stokes equation below accounts for these four aspects of CFD.

### Challenges 
One of the challenges we have to deal with is a varied density of particles in a grid cell due to advection. For example if we have a force pushing to the right applied to particles on the left, The grid cells on the left will have fewer particles in them as time moves on, and the grid cells on the right will have more. This will create a workload imbalance, hindering peak performance from a parallel implementation. Another issue involves dealing with dependencies
